# GLIDE Simulation Framework

This repository contains early-stage physics and visualization models supporting
**GLIDE**, an orbital-scale momentum exchange and electrodynamic reboost concept
for propellant-minimized spacecraft maneuvering.

The goal of this project is to explore feasibility, scaling behavior, and energy
constraints of tether-based orbital logistics using simplified but physically
grounded models.

## What this repo contains

- Core physics models for:
  - Electrodynamic tether forces
  - Orbital energy exchange
  - Gravity and basic propulsion assumptions
- Simple visualization and plotting tools to inspect system behavior over time

This is **not** a flight-ready simulator. It is an exploratory research tool.
