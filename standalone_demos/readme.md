# Standalone Demonstrations

This folder contains self-contained Python scripts that demonstrate
core GLIDE concepts without relying on the main simulation framework.

Each script is intended to be runnable on its own and focuses on
visualizing and inspecting specific orbital mechanics behaviors.

## glide_orbit.py

Simulates a simplified orbital momentum-exchange event and produces:
- An animated orbital trajectory
- Post-event diagnostic plots (e.g. perigee, apogee, energy trends)
- Basic conservation checks for sanity verification

This script is meant as a conceptual demonstration and visualization aid,
not a flight-accurate model.
